# TODO: Implement a function that receives la ist of frames,
#       and returns a list of phases of the fringes in the frames.

# TODO (?): Implement a function that receives a list of frames and converts them
#           to a more convinient format before passing them to the above function.


# TODO: This file should contain the main function.
#       - Initialize the camera and engine (engine is not implemented yet)
#       - Begin an enless loop of:
#           1) Read frames (the last 5 for example)
#           2) Get fringe phases from frames.
#           3) Calculate phase error direction (if we choose gradient descent algorithm)
#           4) Mathemtically translate phase error to distance to change.
#           5) Tell the engine how to move.
